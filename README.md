## Prerequisites

### For the web app (backend + frontend)
| Tool | Version | Download |
|---|---|---|
| JDK | 22 | [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net) |
| Node.js | 22 LTS | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| Git | Any | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) |

### For Docker (optional but recommended)
| Tool | Download |
|---|---|
| Docker Desktop | [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop) |

### For the desktop app (optional)
| Tool | Download |
|---|---|
| Rust toolchain | [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) |
| C++ build tools | Windows: [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) |
| Xcode CLT | macOS: `xcode-select --install` |
| WebKit dev libs | Linux: see [Desktop App](#desktop-app-tauri) section |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone or unzip the project
cd NewPipeWeb

# 2. Start everything with Docker
docker compose up --build

# 3. Open in browser
open http://localhost:3000
```

That's it. The backend runs on port 8080, frontend on port 3000.

---

## Running in Development

Running without Docker gives you hot-reload on both frontend and backend.

### 1. Start the backend

```bash
cd backend

# First run: Gradle will download all dependencies including NewPipeExtractor
./gradlew run

# On Windows:
gradlew.bat run
```

The backend starts on **http://localhost:8080**.

On first run Gradle downloads dependencies — this takes 1–3 minutes.
Subsequent starts are much faster.

### 2. Start the frontend

> **Note:** This project uses `pnpm` to improve installation speed, reduce storage usage, and ensure consistent dependencies. But you may also use `npm` or `yarn` if you prefer.

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install      # first run only
pnpm run dev
```

The frontend starts on **http://localhost:5173**.

The Vite dev server proxies all `/api` requests to the Ktor backend automatically,
so you don't need to configure CORS or URLs manually.

### 3. Open the app

Navigate to **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

---

## Running with Docker

Docker runs the full stack (backend + frontend + nginx) in containers.

```bash
# Build and start
docker compose up --build

# Run in background
docker compose up --build -d

# Stop
docker compose down

# View logs
docker compose logs -f backend
docker compose logs -f frontend
```

### Ports
| Service | Port |
|---|---|
| Frontend (nginx) | http://localhost:3000 |
| Backend (Ktor) | http://localhost:8080 |

### Persistent data
Docker mounts two local directories as volumes:

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| `./data/` | SQLite database (history, playlists, subscriptions, etc.) |
| `./downloads/` | Downloaded video and audio files |

These persist across container restarts. Back them up to keep your data.

---

## Desktop App (Tauri)

The desktop app wraps the web frontend in a native window using Tauri.
It requires the Ktor backend to be running separately.

### Install Rust

```bash
# Install rustup (the Rust toolchain manager)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Restart your terminal, then verify:
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

### Install system dependencies

**Windows:** Install [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
and select "Desktop development with C++".

**macOS:**
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev build-essential
```

### Run the desktop app

```bash
# Make sure the backend is already running:
cd backend && ./gradlew run

# In a new terminal, start the frontend dev server:
cd frontend && pnpm run dev

# In another terminal, start the desktop app:
cd desktop
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

A native window opens pointing at the frontend. Any changes to the frontend
hot-reload in the window automatically.

### Build a distributable

```bash
cd desktop
pnpm run build
```

Output is in `desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.
- Windows: `.msi` installer
- macOS: `.dmg`
- Linux: `.AppImage` or `.deb`

## SponsorBlock

SponsorBlock is a community-driven project that crowdsources timestamps for
skippable segments in YouTube videos.

### How it works in NewPipe Web

1. Go to **Settings** and enable **SponsorBlock**.
2. Choose which segment categories you want to skip.
3. When you watch a video, the app fetches segment timestamps from
   `sponsor.ajay.app` using only the video ID.
4. When your playback position enters a segment, it automatically skips to
   the end of that segment.
5. A brief toast notification shows what was skipped.
6. A counter in the player toolbar shows how many segments were skipped.

### Privacy

- Only the **video ID** is sent to the SponsorBlock API.
- Your watch history, identity, and IP address are not associated with any
  user account in SponsorBlock.
- SponsorBlock is **disabled by default**. You must explicitly enable it in Settings.
- If the SponsorBlock API is unreachable, video playback continues normally.

### Contributing

If you notice incorrect segments or want to contribute timestamps, install the
[SponsorBlock browser extension](https://sponsor.ajay.app) or use the
[Android app](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/SponsorBlock).

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start

**`Could not find com.github.TeamNewPipe:NewPipeExtractor`**
- Make sure JitPack is in your repositories in `build.gradle.kts`
- Run `./gradlew dependencies` to force a dependency refresh
- Check your internet connection — JitPack needs to build the library on first fetch

**`Port 8080 already in use`**
- Something else is running on 8080
- Change the port in `Application.kt`: `port = 8081`
- Update `vite.config.ts` proxy target to match

### Videos won't play

**Stream URLs expire** — NewPipeExtractor stream URLs are valid for roughly 6 hours.
If you leave a video paused for a long time and come back, you may need to refresh
the page to get fresh stream URLs.

**`No playable stream found`** — YouTube occasionally changes its internal API.
Check the [NewPipeExtractor releases](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor/releases)
for a newer version and update `build.gradle.kts`.

### SponsorBlock not working

- Make sure it's **enabled in Settings** (it's off by default)
- Check at least one segment category is selected
- Open browser DevTools → Network tab and look for requests to `sponsor.ajay.app`
- If requests return 404, the video has no community-submitted segments yet

### Docker issues

**Backend container exits immediately**
```bash
docker compose logs backend
```
Look for the error. A common cause is a JDK version mismatch in the Dockerfile.
Verify that the base image is set to `eclipse-temurin:22-jre-alpine`. If a different or unsupported JDK version is specified, update it to a supported version.

**`bind: address already in use`**
Change the host port in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "8081:8080"   # host:container
```

### Desktop app (Tauri)

**`cargo not found`** — Install Rust: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

**`WebKit2GTK not found`** (Linux) — Install system dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev librsvg2-dev
```

**White screen in desktop window** — Make sure both the backend (`./gradlew run`)
and the frontend dev server (`pnpm run dev`) are running before launching Tauri.
